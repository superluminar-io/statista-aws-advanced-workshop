# Ideas For Improvements

- find a way to verify caching locally and in aws works
  then clean up security groups / connections in ecs-stack

- dockerfile optimization with multi-stage build
- remove `?` and `!` from props where it makes sense
- cloudshell, speedtest py script -> 1.4Gbps
  cloudshell has docker preinstalled
  k6 via docker -> works, but better not advertise it, as it might be recognized as a DDoS attack by AWS
- add architecture diagram to intro/welcome/lab_0/lab_1/...
- send feedback link & reminder
- lab_10 has no goal
